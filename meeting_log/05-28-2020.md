## Minutes

**Overview of what I have completed**

- Did another pilot test
- Finished prelim draft
- Haven't started scheduling interviews because HE application is still pending

**General discussion**

- Start reaching out to people anyway to schedule them in. Don't want to get held up too much.
- For the pilot study in your prelim make it a proper findings report
- Cite Brendan's actual paper - not honours report
- Cite the supervisors in the background
- Gantt chat, longer interview section; should go up to tri 2 midsemester break probably
- Week 8 this week
- Should aim to interview now by the end of trimester one
- Coding should also occur during the interview stage
- Remove transcribing from the HE application - takes too long. Supporting documents consequently need to be changed in the HE application.
