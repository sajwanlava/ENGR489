## Minutes

**Overview of what I have completed**

- Emailed Isobel about the HE application - no response, but the workflow listed is 'Research Office Post Review'.
- Did a summary of Hala and Sonia's survey research.
- Did a pilot study on Rachel Anderson from last year - still to transcribe it, but yes the questions are a bit all over the place.
- Set up an ecs webpage on https://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~sajwanlava/
- Will put up prelim draft on gitlab potentially late next week - after SWEN301.
- Emailed Nathan about what questions he wished he asked - waiting on a response.

**Questions from my end**

- Can I approach people before human ethics has been granted?
- Looking at my questions, there is more of a underlining aspect of education which was mentioned last week. If I were to focus on that would that be an "worthwhile" direction to go down? I use that word very colloquially. How would I approach grounded theory based on that?
