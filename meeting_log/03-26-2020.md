## Minutes

**Topic of study** <br>
Am now confused about what to choose because the past study was quite in-depth. Here are my options as discussed in the meeting:<br>

- Keep the same topic
- Bring on Craig as a secondary supervisor and do a functional programming topic
- 'Programmers and their choices of tools)
- Do a pilot study beforehand to see what people might be interested in

Issues with some of these could be that the topic is far too niche and it will make finding interviewees harder than it already is because of covid-19.

Also with the pilot study, might be difficult to do before human ethics clearance.

**Progress update** <br>
Sent two drafts off to be looked at. So far all good, but now need to decide where I want the study to go in terms of topic.
