## Minutes

**How did he come up with interview questions?**<br>
Came up with with questions, by making it very general from the beginning, and then as he went on he knew what to start asking. Keep it general, because it gives participants the option to talk.

**Goal of study?**<br>
Mine is currently a bit vague about what I want to find out. He said that, that's okay, he didn't know when he went to the interview process and then as he went onwards, he decided that.

**What took the longest?**<be>
Analysis took the longest. This part occurred after the interviews, and that way you could find out more questions to ask from there. However, after interviews are done, it takes maybe about 2 weeks to do just because you've done a lot of it during the interview process.

**How did he choose the topic of study?** <br>
He doesn't remember, but he thinks it was because he had learned about Agile at uni and wanted to learn more about how it's applied in industry.

## Key Notes:

**START YOUR REPORT EARLY. THERE ARE ALWAYS THINGS TO ADD!!!**
