**Overview of what I have completed**

- Still analysing
- Have pushed back interviews to the mid-tri break

I haven't done a lot, this half of semester was a bit hard

**General discussion**

- That's okay as long as you are on track - Yes
- Get on top of analysing and when I finish interviews in the break it will set me up fine for finishing the project.
- There are other avenues such as extending if I am finding it particularly challenging.
