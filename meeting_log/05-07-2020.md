## Minutes

**Overview of what I have completed**

- Sent through excel sheet for contacts
- Sent through initial draft of questions
- On the same length for prelim

**General discussion**

- Send an email to human ethics to check up on where the application is
- Start writing summaries of reports to put in your prelim
- The questions were too broad and there were too many --> not specific enough
- You can do pilot testing - for a feel of what interests you - to judge how long it takes
  **- Example questions:** - Has their been a specific issue when you have been working? - Can you think of a security related issue that affected your work negatively?
- Compare with Nathan, Hala and Charles, questions.
  - If they are the same, change them
  - Perhaps email Nathan, Hala, Charles about questions they would ask again

Have a look at the pandemic programming report
