## Minutes

**Overview of what I have completed**

- More people emailed for interviews. Have done 10, and have one after this at 5:30pm, and have another one next Tuesday (29/09/2020) at 4:30pm. Still waiting on 2 more responses. It will get me to 14 interviews.
- Lacking in analysing due to being busy with job things and other courses. Have had five interviews this week and have an assessment day tomorrow and another follow up interview. Next Monday I have yet another follow up interview.

**General discussion**

- Need to pick up on the analysing. I am a bit behind compared to others and as mine is qualitative I need to provide some stuff for supervisors to look over next week.
- You need to strictly plan your last three weeks. Send through a timetable and diagram of the categories and how they relate to each other tonight.
