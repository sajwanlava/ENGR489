## Minutes

**Overview of what I have completed**

- Proposal done
- Human ethics application was completed last Wednesday, reviewed and submitted by James yesterday (15/4), and now pending review by the committee
- Have had meetings with both Brendan and Nathan
- Am just reading through GTM stuff.

**General discussion**

- Try read the grounded theory textbook by Kathy Charmaz
- Do keep the questions open-ended
- Don't do a formal reading of literature around security, but you definitely have to read up enough to understand what people are saying and your actual topic (eg. OWASP). Need to know enough to maintain a conversation.
