\begin{abstract}

Technologies are continually adapting to match ever-changing trends, and as this occurs, new vulnerabilities are exploited by malignant attackers and can cause significant economic damage to companies. Programmers are therefore repeatedly having to expand knowledge and skills to protect software. We must understand the thinking behind the decisions and influences of programmers to interpret how they implement and adopt security practices. This preliminary report will cover the current progress of the project "Why Do Programmers Do What They Do?"
